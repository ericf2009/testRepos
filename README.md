Gotta start somehow
So, what's a "smart" phone? Start:
- What IBM/Apple/Commodore/Amiga/Nokia/Palm/Casio/Matsucom all did to create *personal* computers and make them platforms for a vast array of applications across all domains of work and life: make them small, lightweight, connected, durable, and easy enough to use so we could carry them with us at all times.
Well, that's a little long.  Try a shorter: All we need is the Web with us at all times: whether portable, wearable, or embedded. Then make sure everything is put there.  Not the internet (tcp/ip), with all its special apis, no, the Web: HTTP only.  No compromise.  No proprietary platforms.  Excellent, open-source reference implementations of every major service and feature. *Especially* including the phone, messages & emails, and contact manager.
